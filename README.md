# Fraenkel-Lab
Code I've written for my research position in the Fraenkel Lab at MIT.

### Code use:
Please see .ipynb files for code and descriptions about what the code does. .ipynb files that start with SNF do SNF and spectral clustering. Other .ipynb files are for downstream analysis of clusters. The rest of the files in each folder are inputs or outputs.
